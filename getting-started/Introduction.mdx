Protekt provides secure authentication APIs and SDKs that enable developers to quickly integrate login functionality into their applications.

Protekt offers all the authentication methods your users expect, from traditional passwords, passwordless magic link, OAuth 2.0, JWT, MFA, and social login.

## Protekt Authentication Flow

Your frontend uses the Protekt SDK to authenticate directly with Protekt's servers. Session tokens are passed to your backend, where Protekt's middleware automatically verifies them.
