title: "Setting Up Protekt"
---

Get your Protekt authentication service configured and ready for integration. This process takes about 5 minutes and requires no coding.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your account">
    Visit [protekt.dev](/index) and click **Get Started** to create your free developer account, or [Sign In to your Dashboard](/index) if you already have one.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add your first project">
    New users will see the project creation wizard immediately. 
    
    Existing users can click **New Project** from your dashboard to start the setup process.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure authentication methods">
    Choose how users will authenticate with your application. Select from email and password, social login providers like Google and GitHub, magic links for passwordless authentication, or phone/SMS verification.
    
    You can always modify these settings later in your project dashboard.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up multi-factor authentication">
    Add an extra layer of security by enabling [MFA](/mfa/overview). Choose from authenticator apps, [SMS codes](/mfa/sms/sms-configuration), or [TOTP](/mfa/totp/configuration). This should be configured right after the basic authentication for added security layers.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Ready to integrate">
    Your Protekt project is now configured! Copy your project keys from the dashboard and follow any of our [Quick starts](/getting-started/quick-start/nextjs).
  </Step>
