title: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
---

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds layers of security to your application, protecting user's accounts even after their passwords are stolen. 

It ensures users are who they say they are by requiring them to provide at least two distinct proof for their identity. This prevents up to 99.9% of account attacks.

## How MFA Works
MFA strengthens your security by combining independent verification methods from three factors:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Knowledge Factor">
    **A thing you know (Knowledge Factor):** This is typically a password, a PIN, or the answer to a security question.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Possession Factor">
    **A thing you have (Possession Factor):** This includes a physical or digital token, such as a code from a smartphone app, a hardware key, or an SMS message.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Inherence Factor">
    **What you are (Inherence Factor):** This category uses biometric data like a fingerprint, facial recognition, or a retinal scan.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Protekt MFA uses a combination of these factors to create a secure and simple verification process for your users.


## How Protekt MFA Works

  </Step>

  <Step title="System prompts for second factor">
    Protekt detects MFA is enabled and prompts for additional verification based on user's enrolled methods.
  </Step>

  <Step title="User provides verification">
    User enters code from authenticator app or receives SMS verification code.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access granted">
    After successful verification, user gains access to their account.
  </Step>
</Steps>
